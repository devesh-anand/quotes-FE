For years I've tried to collect the quotes I've loved. Some were written in notebooks, some on random pieces of pages and some I texted people.

Here I'm aiming to collect all the quotes in a single place. I have decided a simple architecture for:

-  Adding new quotes (anyone can add them).
-  A mechanism to control spam/bots submissions.
   -  Captcha.
   -  Personal review by me (am hoping to create a telegram/whatsapp bot that'll send me new quotes for review.)
